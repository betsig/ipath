# ipath

*R package for visualisation of expressed metabolic pathways using iPath3*

## Installation
ipath can be installed:
```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('betsig/ipath')
```
After installation, the package can be loaded into R.
```
library(ipath)

## Introduction

ipath is an in-development package for interacting with the iPath3 (https://pathways.embl.de/ipath3.cgi?map=metabolic) metabolic pathway maps.

ipath allows users to submit a data.frame of pathway ids (for list of compatible ids see: https://pathways.embl.de/help.cgi), and corresponding values for pathway colours and widths, to ipath3 for mapping. ipath then plots the mapped pathways using ggplot2. 


## Usage

COMING SOON.

## Development

ipath is still undergoing development and documentation.
